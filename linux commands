VIRTUAL SERVER: Server which is created on cloud/dc.

TO CREATE SERVER WE NEED TO HAVE AWS ACCOUNT.
TO CREATE SERVER WE NEED TO PERFORM 7 STEPS:

IN AWS OUR SERVERS ARE CALLED AS EC2(ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD) OR INSTANCES.

STEP-1: GIVING TAGS
NAME: NETFLIX

STEP-2: AMI (AMAZON MACHINE IMAG)
OS: Used for communication blw user and computer.
AMI: AMAZON LINUX 2
IN REAL TIME 95% OF SERVERS ARE ON LINUX OS ONLY.

STEP-3: INSTANCE TYPE
HERE WE CAN SELECT RAM & CPU FOR OUR SERVER.
T2.MICRO = 1 CPU & 1 GB 

STEP-4: KEYPAIR
WE WILL GET 2 KEYS 1. PUBLIC KEY 2. PRIVATE KEY
PUBLIC=AWS 
PRIVATE=USER
TYPE OF KEYS: PEM KEY 

STEP-5: NETWORK SETTING
WE CAN SELECT NETWORK AND SECURITY GROUPS
SSH (secure shell-22)	: used to connect to server
ALL TRAFFIC(0-65535)	: to connect with all ports

WE CAN CREATE 1 SECURITY GROUP AND 1 KEYPAIR AND USE FOR MULTIPLE SERVERS.

STEP-6: STORGE (EBS VOLUME)
THE DEFALUT STORE IS 8 GB 
BUT WE CAN EXTEND UP TO 16 TB

STEP-7: LUNCHING INSTANCE



TO HOST AN APPLICATION:
sudo -i
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd


cd /var/www/html
yum install git -y

TYPES OF OS:
1. WINDOWS
2. LINUX
3. MAC OS


LINUX IS A FREE AND OPEN-SOURCE OS.
OS= COMMUNICATION BLW USER AND COMPUTER.
WRITTEN IN C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.
LINUS TORVALDS -- > 1991 -- > 1992

IMPORTANCE:
86% OF MOBILES IS RUNNING ON LINUX PLATFORM.
95% OF SERVERS IS RUNNING ON LINUX PLATFORM.
TOP 500 SUPER COMPUTER IS RUNNING ON LINUX PLATFORM.
SMART WATCH, REFRIGIRATOR, SMART TVS ----------- IS RUNNING ON LINUX PLATFORM.


WHY LINUX:
1. FREE & OPEN-SOURCE
2. LESS BUGS
3. SPEED 
4. MULTI-USER BASED
5. MULTI-PROGRAMMING SUPPORT (JAVA, PYTHON, JS) 
6. IT WILL WORK ON ALL NETWORKS

COMPONENTS: 
KERNEL: MANAGES THE HARDWARE COMPONENTS (RAM, CPU ----)
IT IS ALSO CALLED AS LOWEST LEVEL OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM.

DAEMON: MANAGES THE BACKGROUND SERVICES (SOUNDS, LIGHTS --)
WHEN YOU START YOUR PC.

SHELL: MANAGES THE USER INPUT (COMMANDS, SCRIPTS & PROGRAMS)
IT WILL TAKE INPUT FROM USER AND GIVES THE OUTPUT.

MODES:
1. GUI: GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE
2. CLI: COMMAND LINE INTERFACE 
IN REAL TIME WE WORK ON CLI MODE (COMMAND)


14PROMAX, 14PRO, 14PLUS, 14MINI, 14

LINUX: FLAVOURS/DISTRIBUTIONS

UBUNTU
REDHAT
CENTOS
FEDORA
DEBIAN
================================================================================

TERMINAL IS USED TO CONNECT TO OUR SERVERS
EX: PUTTY, SUPER PUTTY, MOBAXTERM
