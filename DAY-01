1. ONE TIER
2. TWO TIER
3. THREE TIER
4. N TIER

TIER = LAYER = SERVE

LAYERS: 3 TYPES

1. PRESENTATION LAYER:

# TO SEE THE APPLICATION.
# IT IS ALSO CALLED AS CLIENT LAYER. (CLIENT=END USERS)
# IT IS TOP LAYER OF AN APPLICATION.
# PRESENTATION LAYER COMMUNICATES WITH APPLICATION LAYER.


2. APPLICATION LAYER:

# TO USE THE APPLICATION.
# IT IS ALSO CALLED AS LOGIC LAYER.
# IT IS THE MIDDLE LAYER.
# APPLICATION LAYER COMMUNICATE WITH BOTH PRESENTATION AND DATABASE LAYER.

3. DATABASE LAYER:

# TO STORE AND RETRIEVE DATA.
# IT IS ALSO CALLED AS DATA LAYER.
# IT IS LAST LAYER.
# IT WILL COMMINCATE WITH APPLICATION LAYER.


1. ONE TIER ARCHITECTURE:
WE CAN CREATE ONE-TIER APPLICATION (STAND-ALONE APPLICATION)

EX: VLC MEDIA PLAYER

THE PRESENTATION, APPLICATION AND DATABASE LAYER WILL BE ON A SINGLE SIDE.
NOTE: We don't need internet.

2. TWO-TIER ARCHITECTURE:
WE CAN CREATE TWO-TIER APPLICATIONS (CLIENT-SERVER)

EX: JIO SAAVAN

CLIENT-SIDE: PRESENTATION, APPLICATION
SERVER-SIDE: DATABASE LAYER

NOTE: WE NEED THE INTERNET, HERE APP NEED TO BE ON LOCAL DEVICE.

3. THREE-TIER ARCHITECTURE
WE CAN CREATE WEB-APPLICATIONS 

EX: YOUTUBE

CLIENT SIDE: PRESENTATION LAYER
APP SIDE   : APPLICATION LAYER
DB SIDE	   : DATA BASE LAYER

NOTE: WE NEED NOT TO DOWNLOAD APP ON LOCAL DEVICE
WE CAN ACCESS THE APP FROM INTERNET.

4. N-TIER:
DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS

HERE WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE SERVER ON THE APPLICATION.

=====================================================================================
SERVERS:
Serves the services to the end users.
To host the application. 


TYPES: 
1. WEB SERVER: PRESENTATION LAYER	: TO SEE THE APP
2. APP SERVER: APPLICATION LAYER	: TO USE THE APP
3. DB SERVER: DATABASE LAYER		: TO STORE & RETRIEVE DATA


ON-PREM: PHYSICAL SERVERS
CLOUD SERVERS: SERVERS WHICH ARE CREATED ON DATA CENTERS.

AWS -- > SERVER -- > EC2 INSTANCE
EC2: ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD.

AGENDA -- > CREATE A SERVER & HOST NETFLIX APPLICATION

TO CREATE A SERVER WE HAVE 7 STEPS:
ASSUME SERVER = COMPUTER

1. TAGS = NAME 
2. AMI(AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE) = OS, SOFTWARES
3. INSTANCE TYPE = RAM, CPU
4. KEYPAIR = LOGIN TO SERVER (PEM & PPK) [public: aws, private: user]
5. NETWORK = VPC, SECURITY GROUPS (0-65,535)
6. STORAGE = EBS VOLUME (min=8 Gb, max=16 TB)
7. SUMMARY = REVIEW & LAUNCH 

SECURITY GROUPS: TO ALLOW AND RESTRICT THE TRAFFIC.
TRAFFIC = INCOMING REQUEST AND OUTGOING RESPONSE


CONNECT TO SERVER -- > CLICK ON CHECK BOX -- > CONNECT -- > CONNECT

APACHE SERVER -- > TO SHOW THE APPLICATION 
WEB SERVER:
It is used to show the application.
ex: apache, nginx 
port: 80 

#install apache(web server) git(code)
yum install httpd git -y

#start the web server
systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd

#insert the code on default path of apache
cd /var/www/html
git clone https://github.com/CleverProgrammers/pwj-netflix-clone.git
mv pwj-netflix-clone/* .

NOTE: For all free and open-source better to prefer n-1 version.


DIS ADVANTAGES OF WINDOWS:
1. HANG
2. PAID
3. NOT MULTI-USER BASED
4. NOT SUPPORTING FOR MULTI-TASKING


WHY LINUX 
LINUX IS A FREE AND OPENSOURCE OS
LINUX SYSTEMS WILL NOT NOT HANG FREQUENTLY.
IT IS A MULTI-USER-BASED OS
IT WILL SUPPORTED FOR MULTI-TASKING


WHAT IS LINUX 
IT IS A FREE AND OPEN-SOURCE OS.

OPERATION SYSTEM: Its used for communication blw user and system.
OPEN-SOURCE: We can see the code, change the code and distribute the code.

Linux torvalds invented the linux with c language.
linux comes in market 1991.

FLAVORS/DISTRIBUTIONS:

IPHONE: MINI, PLUS, PRO, PROMAX 
LINUX: REDHAT, CENTOS, FEDORA, AMAZONLINUX, UBUTNU, DEBIAN 

DOWNLOAD LINUX: NOT REQ

WHERE: 
ANDROID
SMART WATCHES, TV
SERVERS
SUPER COMPUTERS (500/500)

=================================================
STEP-1: USER EMAIL, NAME & CODE AND PASSWORD
STEP-2: Contact Information 
STEP-3: Billing Information 
STEP-4: VERIFY CONTACT 


LINUX COMMANDS: 

MODES OF LINUX:
GUI: GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE
CLI: COMMAND LINE INTERFACE

By default we login with ec2-user 
but in real we work with root user.
(ec2-user: default root=admin)



sudo -i: to switch to root user
clear/ ctlr l: to clear the screen
touch file1: to create a file
ls/ll: to list the files
cat file: to show content in file1
cat>>file1: to insert content in file1
ctrl d: to save the content
cp file1 file2: to copy the content from file1 to file2
mv file1 raham: to rename file to raham
rm file1: to remove the file1
rm file2 -f: to remove file2 forcefully
touch file{1..10}: to create file1 to file10
rm * -f: to remove all files forcefully
rm j* -f: to remove all files starting with j
rm p* -f: to remove all files starting with p


head file1: shows first 10 lines
head -5 file1: it shows first 5 lines
head -12 file1: it shows first 12 lines	
tail file1: shows bottom 10 lines
tail -5 file1: it shows bottom 5 lines
tail -12 file1: it shows bottom 12 lines	

sed -n '5,15p' file1: to pint line 5 to 15
